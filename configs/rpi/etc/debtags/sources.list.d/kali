# Kali specific tags for the "pentest" facet

# Copy of Debian official tags

# We need those because the Kali mirror doesn't export tag information
# in the "Packages" file. reprepro doesn't preserve that information
# and Debian doesn't publish any ready-to-use override file to
# re-integrate those fields in arbitrary mirrors.
